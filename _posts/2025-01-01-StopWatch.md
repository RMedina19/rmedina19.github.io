The past summer I joined The Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation to develop the [StopWatch](https://ctastopwatch.miurban-dashboards.org/) tracks how bus service has changed in the city of Chicago after the COVID-19 pandemic. My team and I developed a pipeline to periodically scrape the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) API for real-time location of every bus in the city. We have build a comprehensive data set from June 2022 up to date and automatically produce performance statistics which are then visualized in a dynamic platform.

This is an [open source project](https://github.com/mansueto-institute/cta-stop-watch).
